# Elevator Sim

The Elevator Sim is a simulation of an elevator. Quick project idea from [the App Ideas Collection repo](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/3-Advanced/Elevator-App.md)

To ease myself into this, I'm going to tackle this project twice:

1. With Vanilla JS, plain CSS, and no build tools
2. With React, SCSS and Webpack (or something else)
